    "Task: Scrape data from a job search website\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Website: Indeed.com\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: Collect job postings that match certain keywords and location filters, and then perform data analysis to extract insights about the job market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose a location and a set of keywords that are relevant to your field of study. For example, you can schoose a field such as data science, computer science, or any other field you are interested in. In terms of the location, you might choose to search for \"data analytics\" jobs in \"San Francisco\". You are free to choose the field and location on this assignment.\n",
    "2. Scrape job postings from Indeed.com using selenium and python. Your code should extract the following information for each job posting:\n",
    "- Job title\n",
    "- Company name\n",
    "- Job description\n",
    "- Job location\n",
    "- Date posted\n",
    "3. Clean and preprocess the data as necessary. You may want to remove duplicates and perform other data cleaning tasks to prepare the data for analysis.\n",
    "4. Use data analysis techniques to extract insights about the job market. For example, you might:\n",
    "- Identify which companies are hiring the most for the given job titles and locations.\n",
    "- Determine the distribution of job titles and their average salaries.\n",
    "- Analyze the frequency of certain keywords in job descriptions, and determine which skills and qualifications are most in demand.\n",
    "5. Write a report summarizing your findings. Your report should include tables and visualizations to support your conclusions, and should provide actionable insights that could be used by job seekers, employers, or policymakers.\n",
    "Submit your code and report as a single .ipynb file (you can do it in this current notebook as a combination of code cells and markdown cells), along with any necessary instructions for running your code. Make sure your code is well-documented and organized, and that your report is well-written and easy to follow. <br> <br>\n",
    "Note: You do not need to perform text analysis or create word clouds for this exam. However, if you are interested in learning more about these techniques, you may want to explore them on your own as a side project.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Here is the rubric that I will use to grade your final exam:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Item                        | Weight |\n",
    "|-----------------------------|--------|\n",
    "| Code accuracy               | 25%    |\n",
    "| Code clarity and annotation | 25%    |\n",

    "The findings of this project are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The number of active job listings that a particular company is promoting may affect interest on Indeed. Without further analysis, we cannot say whether this has a positive or negative relationship in hiring new employees, it does highlight a few logical points. A larger number of listings indicates a significant presence on Indeed and potentially means that the company is offering a wide range of job opportunities. Job seekers may consider exploring career options with this company and may feel more comfortable doing so with a larger company with more of these opportunities. For example, in the table below, it is clear that Brandeis University is dominating in terms of active job listings, with 116 opportunities available. Further data could suggest that Brandeis has more success in hiring new employees quicker because of the range of opportunities available as well as the exposure on the website. However, this is not to say that a job at a company such as Capital One, with 41 active listings, is any less valuable. Of course, it depends on the reputation of the company itself and the types of jobs that are in demand at a certain time. But this data does indicate that there MAY be a relationship between number of active job listings and hiring success rate.\n",

    "2. The distribution of remote and in-person job opportunities within this dataset could be helpful in understanding the current needs of job seekers and employers. Job seekers can use this information to focus their search on Indeed based on the type of work arrangement that aligns with their goals. Employers and policymakers can also utilize this information to understand the current landscape of remote work opportunities and make informed decisions regarding workforce policies and job market trends. Especially with the pandemic, there has been a consistent rise in job opportunities that are at least partially remote for health safety and convenience. It is important to understand how the ratios between remote and in-person opportunities are changing in the coming years to better understand the goals of both job seekers and employers. For example, in the section below, there is clear information on these numbers. Out of 1500 data analytics jobs listed on Indeed for Boston MA, 557 of them are offered as hybrid or fully remote and 943 do not mention those capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are 557 job opportunities that are at least partially remote.\n",
    "There are 943 job opportunities that are in person.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The prominence of certain keywords in the Indeed job descriptions may indicate employer preferences for skills and experience in positions at their companies. Job seekers can use this information to tailor their resumes and highlight relevant skills and experiences that certain employers will prioritize. Employers can also use this information to gain insights into industry trends and preferences when crafting job descriptions and assessing job seeker's profiles. For example, the searched keywords for this dataset were \"advanced\", \"analysis\", 'visualization', 'experience', and 'team'. The counts shown below suggest that employers are seeking candidates with advanced skills/knowledge in data analysis and data visualization. It also shows that prior experience in related fields could make a profile stand out and that working in teams is crucial for many of the job opportunities in the field. Using this code, any keyword could be searched and counts data will be provided. This would be incredibly useful to all participants on Indeed to better understand the data analytics job market in the area.\n",
